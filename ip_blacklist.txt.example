# IP Blacklist
# =============
# Add one IP address per line to block all requests from that IP.
# Blocked IPs will receive a rate limit error response.
#
# Format:
#   - One IP per line
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
#   - Inline comments are supported (e.g., 1.2.3.4 # some attacker)
#
# The file is automatically reloaded when changed (no restart required).
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to ip_blacklist.txt
#   2. Add IPs you want to block
#   3. The proxy will automatically pick up changes
#
